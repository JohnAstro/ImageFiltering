# ImageFiltering
This program gets a gray level image and passes three filters on it.

## Median Filter
The program will create three gray level images with salt and pepper noise, each with different percentages (10%, 15%, and 20%).
When the noisy images are created, the program will pass three different mask sizes (3x3, 5x5, and 7x7) on each of the noisy images. There will be a total of 12 images in this step.

## Minimum Filter
This will pass a minimum filter with three different masks (3x3, 5x5, and 7x7) on a gray level image with **no** noise.

## Maximum Filter
This will pass a maximum filter with three different masks (3x3, 5x5, and 7x7) on a gray level image with **no** noise.
